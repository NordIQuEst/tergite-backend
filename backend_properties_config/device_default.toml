# Device configuration file
#
# This file is meant to support the values provided by the measurement
# routines committed in the code so far. It can be used as a template
# for configuring properties of the actual device at hand.

# See load_config.py for information about the load order of layout
# configuration, property templates, and device configuration.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Device layout configuration section

[layout]
# The items of this section correspond to component types and their
# sub-items correspond to their indices/identities. This also works as
# a way to declare what components are supported/present in the
# device.

# Device section: Configures device properties with additional information:

# These must be declared in property_templates TOML file to be valid:

# Example of non-indexed properties, i.e., properties of the "whole chip"

# This is a "one-liner property",
