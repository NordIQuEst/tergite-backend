# Copy this file to a .env file in the tergite-backend folder.
# The .env file is a simple list of keys and values. It is also known as the INI file on MS Windows.
# Fill in the necessary values.

# (1) General
# Set the default file prefix and the backend name for the backend application.
# If you are using any of the backends from the mongoDB, please enter this name for DEFAULT_PREFIX
DEFAULT_PREFIX=qiskit_pulse_1q

# (2) Jobs and workers
# This first block can be left as is. Do not change any variable unless you know what you are doing!
# It contains definitions for the temporary directories and file names.
STORAGE_ROOT=/tmp
LOGFILE_DOWNLOAD_POOL_DIRNAME=logfile_download_pool
LOGFILE_UPLOAD_POOL_DIRNAME=logfile_upload_pool
JOB_UPLOAD_POOL_DIRNAME=job_upload_pool
JOB_PRE_PROC_POOL_DIRNAME=job_preproc_pool
JOB_EXECUTION_POOL_DIRNAME=job_execution_pool
# Store the temporary data from the backend-specific executor class
EXECUTOR_DATA_DIRNAME=executor_data

# (3) BCC
# This is to configure port and URLs for the backend machine.
# Running it locally:
BCC_MACHINE_ROOT_URL=http://host:port
# Or a remote VM:
# BCC_MACHINE_ROOT_URL=http://host:port
BCC_PORT=8000

# (4) MSS
# This is to configure port and URL for the frontend machine.
# Running it locally:
MSS_MACHINE_ROOT_URL=http://host:port
# Or a remote VM:
# MSS_MACHINE_ROOT_URL=http://host:port
MSS_PORT=8002

# (5) Instrument interfacing and simulators
# This is to configure the hardware or simulated measurement instruments.
# The type of instrument setup to run.
#
# Can take:
# - quantify
# - qiskit_pulse_1q
#
# Default is "quantify".
# Note: - 'quantify' can be the real instruments or dummy clusters
#       - 'qiskit_pulse_1q' is a one-qubit simulator based on qiskit-dynamics library
EXECUTOR_TYPE=qiskit_pulse_1q
# The path to the configuration file for quantify. Default is "quantify-config.yml" in project directory.
QUANTIFY_CONFIG_FILE=quantify-config.yml

# (6) Authentication
# The app token used to authenticate this BCC with MSS.
# A system user (user with the system role) should log in to QAL 9000, generate an app token
# and set it here.
MSS_APP_TOKEN=
# Default is true. Setting this to False in production will raise a ValueError at startup.
IS_AUTH_ENABLED=True

# (7) Operation mode
# APP_SETTINGS reflect which environment the app is to run in.
# Options:
#  - development
#  - production
#  - staging
#  - test
# Default is production
APP_SETTINGS=production

# Whether to run with MSS or not
# Default is false. Setting this to true when MSS is not running will raise connection errors
IS_STANDALONE=False

# (8) Redis storage
# If you do not want to configure a custom redis instance, you can also not set (i.e. delete all the variables of
# this section in the .env file), because the defaults will assume a default redis installation.
# Set the host on which redis is running
# Default is "localhost"
REDIS_HOST="localhost"
# Set the port on which redis is running
# Default is 6379
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Redis authentication:
# For more information, please read in the redis documentation: https://redis.io/topics/acl
# Set the user on which to connect to redis
# REDIS_USER=""
# Set the password, which to use when connecting to redis
# REDIS_PASSWORD=""
