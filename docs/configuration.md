# Configuration

Documentation about configuring BCC

## General Configuration

To configure the entire application, we use `.env` files.   

Just copy the [`dot-env-template.txt`](../dot-env-template.txt) to `env` and update the variables there in.

```shell
cp dot-env-template.txt .env
```

## QBLOX Instruments Configuration

We use the [`quantify-config.example.yml`](../quantify-config.example.yml) as a template for how to configure this application
to control the [QBLOX instruments](https://qblox-qblox-instruments.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/main/index.html) that control the quantum computer. 

It is well documented. Just copy it to `quantify-config.yml` and update its variables and you are good to go.

```shell
# on the root of the project
cp quantify-config.example.yml quantify-config.yml
```

### Dummy QBLOX Instrumments

You may wish to run some dummy QBLOX instruments if you don't have access to the physical QBLOX instruments

We already have a preconfigured [`dummy-quantify-config.yml`](../app/tests/fixtures/dummy-quantify-config.yml) for this in the 
`app/tests/fixtures` folder.   

Copy it to your root folder.

```shell
# on the root of the project
cp app/tests/fixtures/dummy-quantify-config.yml quantify-config.yml
```

_NOTE: You can find out more about the configuration properties in the quantify-config file by 
visiting the [quantify_scheduler docs](https://quantify-os.org/docs/quantify-scheduler/dev/reference/qblox/Cluster.html)
and the [QCoDeS drivers docs](https://microsoft.github.io/Qcodes/)._  

_NOTE: You could choose to use a different name for your quantum executor config file e.g. `foobar.yml`.
You however need to explicitly set this name in the `.env` file `QUANTIFY_CONFIG_FILE=foobar.yml`_  

### General Backend Configuration

We configure all backends using the `backend_config.toml`.   
We use the [`backend_config.example.toml`](../backend_config.example.toml) as a template.  

This configuration file can contain the calibration values in case we are running it as a simulator.
The calibration values are under the key `simulator_config`. 

**Note: the `simulator_config` is ignored if the `general_config.simulator` variable is not set to `true`.**    

_NOTE: You don't need to pass the `.env` file, the `backend_config.toml` file or the `quantify-config.yml` file to the 
start script as these are automatically loaded for you._  

#### Single-qubit-gate Qiskit Pulse Simulator

You may wish to run a single-qubit simulator.  

First update the `.env` file to contain `EXECUTOR_TYPE=qiskit_pulse_1q`.  

We already have a preconfigured [`backend_config.simq1.toml`](../app/tests/fixtures/backend_config.simq1.toml) for this in the 
`app/tests/fixtures` folder.   

Copy it to your root folder.

```shell
# on the root of the project
cp app/tests/fixtures/backend_config.simq1.toml backend_config.toml
```

And run the application.

```shell
./start_bcc.sh
```

#### Two-qubit-gate Qiskit Pulse Simulator

You may wish to run a two-qubit-gate simulator.  

First update the `.env` file to contain `EXECUTOR_TYPE=qiskit_pulse_2q`.  

We already have a preconfigured [`backend_config.simq2.toml`](../app/tests/fixtures/backend_config.simq2.toml) for this in the 
`app/tests/fixtures` folder.   

Copy it to your root folder.

```shell
# on the root of the project
cp app/tests/fixtures/backend_config.simq2.toml backend_config.toml
```

And run the application.

```shell
./start_bcc.sh
```
